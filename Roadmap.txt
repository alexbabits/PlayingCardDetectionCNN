1. Figure out what the training and validation sets need to be. (Images and their corresponding labels/target).
2. Modify the base MNIST CNN model for the playing cards. 
3. End goal is to output a list of the card predictions from a single screenshot - real world compatibility.

 If you have a limited dataset and want to leverage the knowledge from a larger dataset, transfer learning might be a good option. If you have a small number of images and are not concerned about real-time performance, the sliding window approach with your custom model might be sufficient. However, if you want a more efficient and accurate object detection method that can handle detecting multiple cards within an image, using YOLOv8 for CNNs could be the best choice.




                                Sliding Window Approach:
Pros:

Simple and straightforward to implement.
Can be used with your custom model (CardCNN) without requiring any additional model training or modification.
Can work well for a small number of images and when real-time performance is not a concern.

Cons:

Computationally expensive, especially for large images or many possible card positions and orientations. This can make it inefficient for real-time applications or larger datasets.
Choosing the appropriate window size, stride, and aspect ratio can be challenging and may require experimentation.
May not be as accurate as more advanced object detection algorithms like YOLO.
Difficulty level: Moderate, mainly because of the need to experiment with various window sizes, strides, and aspect ratios to achieve good detection performance.

                                YOLO (You Only Look Once, either v5 or v8):
Pros:

Designed specifically for real-time object detection, making it computationally efficient and fast.
Can handle detecting multiple objects (cards) within an image.
Generally more accurate than the sliding window approach, as it is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm.
Can be fine-tuned with your card dataset to improve its performance on detecting cards specifically.

Cons:

May have a steeper learning curve, especially if you are not familiar with the YOLO architecture and training process.
Requires fine-tuning the YOLO model with your dataset, which can be time-consuming, although transfer learning can speed up the process.
YOLOv8 might have additional improvements and features over YOLOv5, but as I am not familiar with YOLOv8, I can only provide guidance based on YOLOv5 or refer to available documentation for YOLOv8.
Difficulty level: High, mainly due to the need to familiarize yourself with the YOLO architecture, fine-tuning process, and integrating it with your dataset. However, with the available resources, tutorials, and my assistance, it is still achievable.
